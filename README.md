## How Does CircO2 Work?

To understand how CircO2 works, it helps to know what nitric oxide does in the body. Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule that plays a crucial role in relaxing and widening blood vessels, which improves blood flow and circulation throughout the body.

As we age, our natural production of nitric oxide tends to decline, which can affect circulation, energy levels, and overall cardiovascular health. CircO2 is formulated to support the body's ability to produce and maintain healthy nitric oxide levels.

By promoting better circulation, CircO2 aims to help deliver oxygen and nutrients more efficiently to cells and tissues. This can translate into benefits like improved energy, better physical performance, enhanced focus, and support for heart health.

Circulation matters because it affects nearly every system in the body. When blood flows freely, it supports muscle function during exercise, mental clarity during work, and overall vitality in daily activities.

## CircO2 Ingredients Breakdown

### Key Active Ingredients in CircO2

CircO2 contains a targeted blend of ingredients chosen specifically for their potential to support nitric oxide production and cardiovascular health. The main active ingredients typically include:

- **Beetroot Powder:** Rich in dietary nitrates, beetroot is one of the most studied natural sources for supporting nitric oxide production. The body converts nitrates into nitric oxide, which helps relax blood vessels and improve circulation.
- **Hawthorn Berry:** Traditionally used to support heart health, hawthorn berry contains antioxidants and compounds that may help maintain healthy blood pressure levels and cardiovascular function.
- **L-Citrulline:** An amino acid that the body converts into L-arginine, which is then used to produce nitric oxide. L-citrulline is often included in circulation-support formulas for its role in promoting blood flow.
- **Vitamin B12:** Essential for energy metabolism and red blood cell formation, B12 supports overall vitality and can help reduce feelings of fatigue.

L-citrulline has also been studied for its potential to support healthy blood pressure and improve circulation. Hawthorn berry has a long history of traditional use and has been researched for its cardiovascular benefits.
